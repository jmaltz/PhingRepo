We're working on automating our build process at the Rutgers Student Life Media Team. This is a repo we are using to store/test that code until we don't have to worry about copying and pasting all those nasty passwords.

Getting started
===============

Before getting started, you're going to need to configure a thing or two on your end.

Install Phing
-------------

Detailed installations about how to install phing can be found on their website page: [http://www.phing.info/trac/wiki/Users/Installation](http://www.phing.info/trac/wiki/Users/Installation "Installation info")

Setting Up Your Environment
---------------------------
Set your `PHING_HOME` environment variable within your bashrc.  You can do this by running a `locate phing` and pointing it to the root of where most of the files live (search for /something/tasks).

Run sudo -E bash make.sh.  This should set up your phing directory structure to do everything that you want it to


.
